        <p>This two-day workshop with Adrien was an amazing experience. I learned how to make different ice creams, sorbets from fruits, milk and so on. He's very calm and patient and feels what kind of information different people need. I recommend this workshop to anybody who wants to step up their cuisine skills.</p>
